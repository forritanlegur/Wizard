# ðŸ”® Wizard Name Generator ðŸ§™
âœ¨A simple Wizard Name Generator for Unityâœ¨
I decided I wanted to try using classes & constructors in code for Unity and this is the result. 
In its current state the code can be applied to a 3d text mesh pro to display a wizard name. 
This could be used to generate random enemy/companion names in a fantasy rpg. It can easily be 
modified to display text with other methods than TMP.
